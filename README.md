### CoSE project page

####Jekyll Cayman Theme for Papers
The default theme is modified such that the configuration (`_config.yml`) accepts a list of authors and a list of teaser 
figures. The CSS design is responsive and there shouldn't be a problem with mobile devices. You just need to update
`_config.yml` and `index.md` files for your project page.

If you would like to further customize, you should edit `_layouts/default.html` and `assets/css/style.scss` files.
